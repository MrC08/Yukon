# Yukon üèûÔ∏è
This was a game that I made back in my freshman year of high school. The following year I updated it and it won the Alabama Consortium of Technology in Education State Fair in the programming category!

The goal of the game is to travel 100 miles through the Yukon Territory. It started out as a little project to impress my comptuer science teacher who gave us an assignment at the end of the year to make an adventure game. I wanted to make my game as over-the-top as possible because I found it more fun to create something big and exciting instead of just another choose your own adventure. The inspiration for this game was mainly Oregon Trail.

I've seen this game succesfully run with Python 3.9 through 3.12 although it should work with most modern versions. I leaned away from importing libraries not included in the standard libraries to increase its portability; escpecially since it was originally developed in a school setting where installing libraries can be difficult.
